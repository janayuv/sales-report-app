# Database Clear Utility - Complete Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented multiple ways to clear all entries from the database:

### **🛠️ Methods Available:**

#### **1. 🖥️ GUI Method (Recommended)**
- **Location**: Settings page → Development Tools section
- **Button**: "Clear ALL Database Data" (red button)
- **Features**:
  - ⚠️ **Double confirmation** with detailed warning
  - 🔄 **Loading state** during operation
  - ✅ **Success/error notifications**
  - 🔄 **Auto-refresh** after clearing

#### **2. 🔧 Programmatic Method**
- **Function**: `dbManager.clearAllData()`
- **Usage**: Available in frontend code
- **Features**:
  - Works in Tauri mode
  - Graceful error handling
  - Console logging

#### **3. 📱 Command Line Method**
- **Script**: `clear-database.js`
- **Usage**: `node clear-database.js`
- **Features**:
  - Interactive confirmation
  - Direct SQLite operations
  - Alternative file deletion method

### **🗃️ What Gets Cleared:**

The clear operation removes **ALL** data from these tables:
- ✅ **Companies** - All company records
- ✅ **Customers** - All customer records  
- ✅ **Sales Reports** - All sales report data
- ✅ **Categories** - All customer categories
- ✅ **Uploaded Reports** - All file upload records
- ✅ **Report Rows** - All parsed report data
- ✅ **Tally Exports** - All export records
- ✅ **Audit Logs** - All activity logs
- ✅ **Invoice Mappings** - All invoice mapping data
- ✅ **Auto-increment counters** - Reset to start from 1

### **🚀 How to Use:**

#### **Method 1: GUI (Easiest)**
1. Open the application
2. Navigate to **Settings** page
3. Scroll to **Development Tools** section
4. Click **"Clear ALL Database Data"** button
5. Confirm the warning dialog
6. Wait for completion notification

#### **Method 2: Command Line**
```bash
cd sale-report-app
node clear-database.js
```

#### **Method 3: Programmatic**
```typescript
import { dbManager } from './utils/database';

// Clear all data
await dbManager.clearAllData();
```

### **⚠️ Safety Features:**

1. **Double Confirmation**: GUI method requires explicit confirmation
2. **Detailed Warning**: Shows exactly what will be deleted
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback
4. **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operation
5. **Auto-refresh**: UI updates automatically after clearing

### **🔧 Technical Implementation:**

#### **Backend (Rust)**
- Added `clear_all_data()` method to `DatabaseManager`
- Proper foreign key constraint handling
- Auto-increment counter reset
- Tauri command exposure

#### **Frontend (TypeScript)**
- Added `clearAllData()` method to `dbManager`
- Integration with Settings component
- Toast notifications for feedback
- Loading state management

#### **Command Line**
- Node.js script with interactive confirmation
- Direct SQLite operations
- Fallback to file deletion method

### **📊 Database Schema Affected:**

```sql
-- Tables cleared in dependency order:
DELETE FROM invoice_mappings;
DELETE FROM audit_logs;
DELETE FROM tally_exports;
DELETE FROM report_rows;
DELETE FROM uploaded_reports;
DELETE FROM sales_reports;
DELETE FROM customers;
DELETE FROM categories;
DELETE FROM companies;
DELETE FROM sqlite_sequence; -- Reset auto-increment counters
```

### **🎯 Use Cases:**

- **🧪 Development**: Clean slate for testing
- **🔄 Reset**: Start fresh with new data
- **🐛 Debugging**: Clear corrupted data
- **📊 Demo**: Clean database for presentations
- **🔄 Migration**: Prepare for schema changes

### **✅ Verification:**

After clearing, you can verify by:
1. Checking that no companies appear in the UI
2. Verifying empty reports table
3. Confirming no customers exist
4. Checking that auto-increment starts from 1

The database will be completely empty and ready for fresh data entry!
