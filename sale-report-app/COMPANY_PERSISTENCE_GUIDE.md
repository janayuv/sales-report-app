# 🏢 Company Persistence Fix - Development Mode

## ✅ **Issue Fixed!**

The company name changes are now **persisted** and will survive app restarts in development mode.

## 🔧 **What Was Wrong**

### **Before:**
- Company changes were only stored in **memory**
- When app restarted → **reset to demo companies**
- Changes were **lost** on every restart

### **After:**
- Company changes are **saved to localStorage**
- When app restarts → **loads saved companies**
- Changes are **persistent** across restarts

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **1. Automatic Persistence**
```typescript
// When you update a company:
1. Update in-memory data
2. Save to localStorage automatically
3. Changes persist across app restarts
```

### **2. Smart Loading**
```typescript
// When app starts:
1. Check localStorage for saved companies
2. If found → load saved companies
3. If not found → initialize with demo companies
4. Save demo companies to localStorage
```

### **3. Development Mode Storage**
- **Storage Key**: `sales_report_dev_companies`
- **Location**: Browser localStorage
- **Format**: JSON array of company objects
- **Persistence**: Survives browser restarts

## 🚀 **Test the Fix**

### **Step 1: Change Company Name**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Company Management**
2. Click **Edit** on "Demo Company 1"
3. Change name to "My Business"
4. Click **Update Company**

### **Step 2: Restart App**
1. **Refresh the browser** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. **Or close and reopen** the browser tab
3. **Or restart** the development server

### **Step 3: Verify Persistence**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Company Management**
2. **Verify** "My Business" is still there
3. **Check** the company selector in header
4. **Confirm** the name didn't reset to "Demo Company 1"

## 🛠️ **Additional Features**

### **Reset Button (Development Mode Only)**
- **Location**: Settings → Company Management → Reset button
- **Function**: Resets companies to default demo values
- **Use Case**: Testing or if you want to start fresh

### **Console Logging**
- **Check browser console** for persistence logs:
  ```
  Loaded companies from localStorage: 2
  Saved companies to localStorage: 2
  Updated company: {id: 1, name: "My Business", ...}
  ```

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### **Storage Implementation**
```typescript
// Save to localStorage
localStorage.setItem('sales_report_dev_companies', JSON.stringify(companies));

// Load from localStorage
const stored = localStorage.getItem('sales_report_dev_companies');
const companies = JSON.parse(stored);
```

### **Error Handling**
- **Graceful fallback** if localStorage fails
- **Default companies** if no stored data
- **Console logging** for debugging

### **Development vs Production**
- **Development Mode**: Uses localStorage persistence
- **Production Mode**: Uses Tauri backend database
- **Automatic detection** of environment

## 🎯 **Benefits**

✅ **Persistent Changes** - Company names survive app restarts  
✅ **Automatic Saving** - No manual save required  
✅ **Error Recovery** - Graceful fallback to defaults  
✅ **Development Friendly** - Easy testing and debugging  
✅ **Reset Option** - Can reset to defaults if needed  

## 🚀 **Ready to Use**

The company management system now has **full persistence** in development mode! Your company name changes will be saved and restored when you restart the app.

**Try it now**: Change a company name, restart the app, and see your changes persist! 🎉
