### Reporting
- **Weekly Reports**: Automated performance and health summaries
- **Artifact Storage**: 30-day retention for build artifacts and reports
- **GitHub Step Summaries**: Detailed workflow execution summaries
- **Issue Tracking**: Comprehensive issue management with labels

## üöÄ Deployment Pipeline

### Build Process
1. **Code Checkout**: Latest code from repository
2. **Environment Setup**: Node.js 18, Rust stable toolchain
3. **Dependency Installation**: npm ci for Node.js, cargo for Rust
4. **Lockfile Generation**: Automatic Cargo.lock generation
5. **Quality Checks**: TypeScript, linting, testing
6. **Build Execution**: Application compilation
7. **Artifact Upload**: Build artifacts stored for deployment

### Quality Gates
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Must pass without errors
- **Linting**: ESLint checks must pass
- **Unit Tests**: All tests must pass
- **Rust Compilation**: Cargo check must succeed
- **Security Scans**: No critical vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Bundle size within acceptable limits

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Cargo.lock Missing
- **Symptom**: `Couldn't load Cargo.lock` error
- **Solution**: Automatic lockfile generation in workflows
- **Prevention**: Explicit lockfile generation step added

#### Dependency Conflicts
- **Symptom**: Build failures due to version conflicts
- **Solution**: Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- **Monitoring**: Weekly dependency health checks

#### Performance Regression
- **Symptom**: Increased bundle size or slower builds
- **Solution**: Weekly performance analysis and optimization suggestions
- **Monitoring**: Bundle size tracking and memory usage analysis

### Workflow Debugging
- **Logs**: Available in GitHub Actions tab
- **Artifacts**: Build artifacts and reports stored for 30 days
- **Step Summaries**: Detailed execution summaries in workflow runs
- **Issue Creation**: Automatic issue creation for failures with context

## üìã Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Weekly**: Review security scan results
- **Weekly**: Check dependency update PRs
- **Weekly**: Review performance optimization suggestions
- **Daily**: Monitor health check results
- **As Needed**: Address critical alerts and issues
